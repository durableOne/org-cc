#+title:Org Context Clues

This is a simple project whose aim is to automatically remind you of
important notes about projects you haven't worked on in a while.
The way it works is that you add your context clues (gotchas, caveats,
important things to remember,...) to each heading as appropriate. When
you clock in on a heading, if it has been more than =org-cc-days= since
you last clocked in you get a buffer displaying the notes for your
current heading and all its parents.

Example:
[[file:screenshot.png]]
The left window shows the org file and the right window shows the
context clues produced when =org-cc-display-notes= is called with the
point in the "Meet Strider" heading.

The main use case for this package is to provide a standard place where
you can stash long notes about each entry without cluttering your main
agenda file. If you have many sub-tasks in a project like the
above case, you may be lost trying to find the notes pertaining to
this task and its "context" (its ancestors). This package shows you
the current heading in the context of its ancestors and any notes you
have made pertaining to that context.

If you go with the suggested configuration below, this package can
also check if you haven't worked on a project in a while and
automatically flash for you important ideas related to that project so
you make sure you remember the key points before you pick up work
again on that project.

* How it works
It uses the same mechanism as =org-attach= to create a notes directory
for the heading (creating a uuid for the heading if needed). When you
call =org-cc-edit-cc-file=, it lets you edit the file =cc.org= in the
current heading's notes directory.

If you invoke =org-cc-display-notes=, your heading is searched for clock entries (*important*: =org-cc=
searches for the =LOGBOOK= drawer; /i.e./, it assumes you have
=org-log-into-drawer= set to =t=) and if no clock entries are found or the
last clocked out entry was more than =org-cc-days= ago, it will display
the context clues.

To force the display of notes regardless of when you last worked on
the heading you can:
1. Set =org-cc-days= to 0 and call =org-cc-display-notes=
2. Call =org-cc-display-notes= with a prefix argument

* Installation
- Clone this repository
- In your init file, make sure you add
  #+begin_src elisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-cc")
  #+end_src
* Example configuration   
#+begin_src elisp 
  (use-package org-cc
    :ensure nil
    :after org
    :custom
    (org-cc-directory (concat org-directory "org-cc")) ;; subdirectory of the heading's attachment directory
    (org-cc-days 14)
    :init
    (add-hook 'org-clock-in-hook #'org-cc-display-notes)
    (evil-leader/set-key
      "k" (lambda () (interactive) (org-cc-edit-cc-file))
      "x" (lambda () (interactive) (org-cc-display-notes t))))
#+end_src

* Features to add
- [X] Allow overriding of =org-cc-days= for each heading with a property

* Known bugs
- The notes file is a full org file and its contents are currently
  inserted into the context clues buffer. If you add headings to it,
  they will not be nested under the org file's headings but will be
  inserted as-is.
